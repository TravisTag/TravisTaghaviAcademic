\indent This thesis work is an exploration into the application of machine learning to various, mostly related, statistical inference tasks.
Machine learning is the process by which an algorithm can recognize patterns or trends in data and act accordingly.
More specifically, as in our case, supervised learning involves training a model with example data - simulated or real - which is labeled with the desired result.
The model then learns how to infer these desired results, and can apply what it has learned to new, unlabeled datasets.

Our inference tasks mostly involve determining, in some sense, the location of wireless devices based on received/monitored signals.
In one instance, we seek to classify wireless devices as being inside or outside of a prescribed area; this is used as a stepping stone to precise occupancy estimation.
In another case, we wish to correlate certain wireless devices, and hence their users, by means of observing sustained or repeated close spatiotemporal proximity.
Another project involves rapidly detecting statistically anomalous images in a stream of high resolution multispectral images.

Overall, we are trying to determine the applicability of various machine learning optimization methods to these types of problems.
The idea is that, while traditionally solved from a purely statistical standpoint, these problems and systems can benefit from machine learning.
