\chapter{RESULTS}

The results of this research are split into the testing of features and learning algorithms, as detailed in the preceding testing methodology.

\section{Feature Evaluation}
As stated previously, plots of the various distances metrics for features are plotted in order to evaluate whether a feature is sufficient.
The average extraction time for each feature for a single image is also shown.
These features were extracted using a single core of an Intel i5 processor with a maximum clock speed of 2.7 GHz.
Shown below are the plots and average extraction time for pixel distribution, BRIEF descriptors, and blob detection.

\subsection{Pixel Distribution}
Below are figures showing the MSEs (figure 3.1), EMDs (figure 3.2), and Bhattacharyya (figure 3.3) distances between consecutive image pairs.



\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/MSEs}}
\caption{Plot of MSEs between distributions of consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/EMDs}}
\caption{Plot of Earth mover's distances between distributions of consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/BDs}}
\caption{Plot of Bhattacharyya distances between distributions of consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}


Spikes in the BD can be seen around the locations of the anomalous images, along with some spikes in other areas.
The MSE has fewer and lower spikes around most anomalies, while the EMD is far noisier than other metrics.
For this reason, the BD was chosen as the distance metric for pixel distribution.
The average time for histogram calculation and Bhattacharyya distance calculation combined is 0.0473 seconds.

\subsection{BRIEF Descriptors}

Below are figures showing the number of BRIEF matches between consecutive images (figure 3.4), as well as the percentage of keypoints matched between images (figure 3.5).


\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/BRIEFnum}}
\caption{Plot of BRIEF matches for consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/BRIEFRatio}}
\caption{Plot of the percentage of keypoints matched between consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}

Contrary to the other metrics which are true distances, a dip can be seen in both metrics around the anomalous images.
The average time for BRIEF extraction for a single image is 0.244 seconds.
Distance metric calculation is a single operation of negligible processing time.

\subsection{Blob Detection}

Below are figures showing the difference in number of blobs (figure 3.6) and the difference in total blob area (figure 3.7) between consectuive image pairs.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/Blobdiff}}
\caption{Plot of the difference in number of blobs between consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\input{Figures/Blobareadiff}}
\caption{Plot of the difference in total blob area between consecutive image pairs.}
\label{fig:tamu-fig3}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the distribution distance plots, spikes can be seen around the anomalous images, as well as in other places.
The average time for extraction of blobs for a single image is 1.06 seconds -- the longest time for any of the considered features.

\section{Learning Algorithm Evaluation}

To evaluate the learning algorithms, these distance metrics were concatenated into feature vectors, and fed along with the corresponding label vector to train each algorithm.
As stated in the testing methodology, the models were then tuned to increase performance, and the final averaged values for detection rate, false alarm rate, and overall accuracy are reported in the table below:

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		Algorithm & Detection Rate & False Alarm Rate & Overall Accuracy  \\ \hline
		Logistic Regression & 0.956 & 0.077 & 0.933  \\ \hline
		Decision Trees & 0.119 & 0.033 & 0.899  \\ \hline
		Neural Network & 0.75 & 0.038 & 0.959  \\ \hline
		SVM & 0.924 & 0.258  & 0.743 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Performance of learning algorithms in anomalous image detection}
\end{table}


The logistic regression model performed the best out of the four algorithms with a 95.6\% detection rate and a 7.7\% false positive rate.
The decision tree predictably performed poorly, as it is a simple model incapable of considering the interaction between features.
The SVM and neural network had decent performance, with the neural network missing 25\% of anomalous image pairs, and the SVM having a fairly high false alarm rate of 25.8\%.

% \section{Yet Another Table}

% Another table is placed here to show the effect of having tables in multiple sections. The list of tables should still double space between table titles, while single spacing long table titles.

% %Fix table labeling.
% \begin{table}[h!]
% 	\centering
% 	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
% 		\hline
% 		Dates & Attendance  \\ \hline
% 		August 8-10, 2008 & 3,523  \\ \hline
% 		August 14-16, 2009 & 4,003 \\ \hline
% 		July 9-11, 2010 & 5,049 \\ \hline
% 		August 5-7, 2011 & 6,891  \\ \hline
% 		August 10-12, 2012 & 9,464  \\ \hline
% 		August 16-18, 2013 & 11,077  \\ \hline
% 		July 18-20, 2014 & 14,686 \\ \hline
% 		July 31-August 2, 2015 & 18,411  \\ \hline
% 	\end{tabular}
% 	\caption{San Japan attendance. Data is taken from \cite{ANCONS}. I intentionally make the title of this table long so the single space effect is seen in the list of tables.}
% \end{table}

% You may be wondering why San Japan was chosen. There are a few reasons as to why I did this:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item It is one of the fastest-growing anime conventions in Texas.
% \item Filler.
% \item I wanted a good variety of table examples.
% \item Because conventions are cool.
% \end{enumerate}
