%These next lines change the font. Fixes for certain
%fonts will be implemented in a future release.

%Comment this line if you do not wish to use Times
%New Roman. The font used will then be the LaTeX
%default of Computer Modern.
\usepackage{times}
%\usepackage{cmbright}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%Do not change these settings. The geometry package
%Adjusts the margins to those specified by the Thesis
%Manual. 
\usepackage[letterpaper]{geometry}

%These are common AMS packages. Many LaTeX documents
%have these packages declared in their preambles.
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm}

%This package allows for the use of graphics in the
%document.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%If you have JPEG format images, add .jpg as an
%allowed file extension below. Same for Bitmaps (.bmp).
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}

%It is best practice to keep all your pictures in
%one folder inside the main directory in which your
%TeX file is kept. Here the folder is named "graphic."
%Replace the name here with your folder's name, if needed.
%The period is needed due to relative referencing.
\graphicspath{ {./graphic/} }

%If needed, this will allow you to add the word "Page"
%to extra pages on your front matter lists.
\usepackage{afterpage}

%This is from the mdwtools package; it fixes some
%footnote commands and allows you to have footnotes in
%tables via the savenotes environment.
\usepackage{footnote}


% Added to fix issues with pdf searching in some versions of LaTeX
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\usepackage{lmodern}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Hyperref setup below.  You should be able to get away with using uncommenting just the first line.
%\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% if \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} doesn't work try this.
% \usepackage{hyperref}  % Hidelinks is an option that removes link visiability.  TAMU Thesis Offices prefers to not see the links. But often doesn't work.  
% 
% \hypersetup{
%     colorlinks=true,
%     linkcolor=black,
%     citecolor=black,
%     filecolor=black,
%     urlcolor=black,
% }
%%%%%%%  End of hyperref setup.  One of these two options should work, but my motto with hyperref is when in doubt, comment it out!
%%%%%%%%%  This hopefully fixes the problem with vertical spacing of section headings at the top of the page..  Commented out in 1.0.7
% \preto\section{%
% \ifnum\value{section}>0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
% }
% \preto\subsection{%
% \ifnum\value{subsection}=0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
% \ifnum\value{subsection}>0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
% }
